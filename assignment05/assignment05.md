1. Create a function that allows swapping of two pointers.<br>

a. Explain what the “main” function does to the CSTACK in order setup the input arguments prior to calling the swap_pointer() function?<br>

b. And what are the values in R0 & R1 when swap_pointer() is called?<br>

c. Share a screen shot of the local variables inside of “main” after the function swap_pointer() returns, showing the values of the pointers and what they are pointing to.<br>
